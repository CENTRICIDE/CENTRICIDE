### ***DNI*** ++  
- basic [c](https://dni-criteria.carrd.co)riteria, the same as always. i am pretty tolerant of a lot of things but if you make me lose my patience or are just that annoying, i won't hesitate to block/hide!
- **MAJOR NONO's**: sexualizing me or my friends that i sit near, if you are a minor and you're on the 18+ server (hope you get your account banned! /silly), if youre finicky about doubles i don't care just block me.
- 🚫 I DONT ACCEPT FRIEND REQUESTS ON SAFE SERVER !! 🚫

### **INT** ++ 
- Ponies within the same [f](https://rentry.co/thoughtcrimes)andoms as me!! feel free to cuddle/boop/hide with my avi! i'm typically slow with replies, sorry in advance!! 
- if it's urgent please whisper as i might be offtab!! crowns are always welcomed and i typically reply with a heart in case that makes you uncomfy!

### **REMINDERS** ++ 
- i may cuddle with my friends but it doesn't *always* necessarily mean that i ship the characters or that i am in the same fandom!
- ***ALSO*** i don't do rp and i never take that stuff seriously! 
if you just start roleplaying out of nowhere, imma act goofy or not reciprocate like at all ..
- **regarding skin copying/taking insp**: imitation is a form of flattery. idc if you copy my skins or takes inspo because this is a silly fun pony game :) if my skins are worth copying then it must mean i'm playing this game right lmaooo
